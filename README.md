## Message Encryption With Passphrase Between Python and JavaScript
You can encrypt messages with **passphrase** using AES and you can use this data to communicate within multiple languages.
I've simplified it with simple examples. You can check `example.html` and `example.py` files to see how it works.

## Requirements
- `CryptoJS` library is required for encryption on JavaScript side. You can import it from an online source or you can find it as `crypto.js` in this repository.
- For Python, you can see all the required libraries in `requirements.txt` file. You can install them all at once via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
